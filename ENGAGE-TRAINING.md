# ENGAGE Fashion Hooks Skill for Gen Z Girls

## Skill Purpose
This skill trains the model to consistently generate high‑impact, psychology‑driven marketing hooks using the ENGAGE formula specifically for fashion products (hoodies, pants, jackets, streetwear) aimed at Gen Z girls (ages ~14–25).

The model must internalize the ENGAGE framework as a repeatable thought process, not a surface pattern. Outputs must feel native to TikTok / Reels culture, emotionally resonant, and identity‑driven. Generic marketing language is unacceptable.

---

## Core Audience Model (Non‑Negotiable)
Gen Z girls:
- Use fashion as **identity signaling**
- Value **comfort + aesthetic**
- Are hyper‑aware of trends and trend fatigue
- Fear looking “basic,” “try‑hard,” or “behind”
- Crave validation but reject obvious advertising
- Respond to stories, taboo truths, and FOMO

---

## Output Requirements
Every output MUST include:
1. A **Grabber** (1 short, scroll‑stopping line)
2. A **Paragraph** (2–4 sentences)
3. Implicit emotional driver (identity, FOMO, confidence, social proof)

Avoid:
- Corporate tone
- Vague claims (“looks cute,” “stylish”)
- Over‑explaining

# ENGAGE TRAINING EXAMPLES

==================================================
E — EXPLOIT COGNITIVE DISRUPTION (10)
==================================================

### Example 1
**Input:** Hoodie, Gen Z girls  
**Grabber:** Your hoodie isn’t comfy — it’s outdated.  
**Paragraph:** Comfort isn’t the problem. Wearing the *same* hoodie everyone else has is. Gen Z fashion rewards originality, not effortlessness — and one small change can flip how your entire outfit is perceived.

**Why this works:** Flips the belief that comfort equals timeless style.

---

### Example 2
**Grabber:** You don’t need better clothes — you need better proportions.  
**Paragraph:** Most outfits fail because the silhouette is wrong. This hoodie cut fixes that instantly, without changing your body or your vibe.

**Why this works:** Reframes the problem as technical, not personal.

---

### Example 3
**Grabber:** Being “low‑effort” is the fastest way to look boring.  
**Paragraph:** Gen Z style isn’t lazy — it’s intentional. This hoodie looks effortless because it’s engineered to hit the right visual cues.

---

### Example 4
**Grabber:** Oversized doesn’t mean shapeless.  
**Paragraph:** Everyone thinks baggy equals cool, but most people wear it wrong. This hoodie proves oversized can still look expensive.

---

### Example 5
**Grabber:** If everyone owns it, it’s already dead.  
**Paragraph:** Trends don’t die slowly — they collapse overnight. This hoodie taps into the *next* look before saturation hits.

---

### Example 6
**Grabber:** Your outfit isn’t failing — the fabric is.  
**Paragraph:** Texture is the quiet flex Gen Z notices first. This hoodie uses it to signal taste without logos.

---

### Example 7
**Grabber:** You’re dressing for comfort in a validation economy.  
**Paragraph:** What you wear still sends a message. This hoodie rewrites that message without sacrificing comfort.

---

### Example 8
**Grabber:** “Basic” isn’t a vibe — it’s a warning sign.  
**Paragraph:** When your hoodie blends in, you disappear. This one does the opposite.

---

### Example 9
**Grabber:** The hoodie didn’t change — the culture did.  
**Paragraph:** What worked last year reads different now. This version is built for today’s aesthetic signals.

---

### Example 10
**Grabber:** Cozy stopped being cool the moment it got easy.  
**Paragraph:** This hoodie brings intention back into comfort.

---

==================================================
N — NARRATE AN UNFINISHED STORY (10)
==================================================

**Paragraph:** I didn’t expect comments. I didn’t expect DMs. But by the end of the day, I knew something had changed.

### Example 2
**Grabber:** I almost didn’t wear these pants…
