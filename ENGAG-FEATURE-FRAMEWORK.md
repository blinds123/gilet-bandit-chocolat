# ENGAG FEATURE COPY FRAMEWORK (The 5-Step Paragraph)

## Purpose
For Feature Cards, we use the first 5 elements of the ENGAGE framework to create a narrative arc within a single paragraph (3-5 sentences). This moves beyond "benefits" into "identity-based storytelling".

## The 5-Step Formula (ENGAG)
1.  **E - Exploit Cognitive Disruption:** Challenge a common belief or habit related to the feature.
2.  **N - Narrate an Unfinished Story:** Introduce a relatable realization or moment of discovery.
3.  **G - Give a Controversial Truth:** State an uncomfortable truth about typical clothing/design.
4.  **A - Attach High-Stakes Conflict:** Highlight emotional/identity frustration.
5.  **G - Guarantee Unconventional Payoff:** Explain the solution/benefit in a surprising way.

## Tone Guidelines
- **Target:** Gen Z Women (Urban/Bohemian).
- **Voice:** Confident, Empathetic, Precise. "Big Sister" energy.
- **Rules:** No urgency, no scarcity, no "marketing buzzwords".

## Validated Examples

### Feature: The Print (Bandana)
**Headline:** THIS PRINT MAKES SILENCE LOUDER
**Body:** You've been trained to believe that 'loud' prints are tacky, so you stick to safe neutrals that make you invisible. But hiding in beige doesn't make you look chic; it makes you look like a background character in your own life. The uncomfortable truth is that most people dress for approval, not impact. This signature bandana print breaks that cycle by forcing attention without you saying a word. It’s the easiest way to turn a basic outfit into a main-character moment.

### Feature: The Material (Cashmere Blend)
**Headline:** TEXTURE IS THE QUIET FLEX
**Body:** Most affordable knits feel like sandpaper disguised as wool, forcing you to wear layers just to survive the itch. We accept this because we think 'softness' is a luxury tax we can't afford. But true style implies comfort; if you're fidgeting, you aren't stylish. You shouldn't have to suffer or spend a fortune just to feel good in your clothes. This 10% Cashmere blend hacks the system, giving you that 'old money' tactile experience with zero itch.

### Feature: The Cut (Silhouette)
**Headline:** YOU DON'T NEED BETTER CLOTHES, JUST BETTER PROPORTIONS
**Body:** Standard cardigans are cut like boxes, making you look shapeless regardless of your actual size. You keep buying them hoping for a 'cozy' vibe but end up feeling frumpy and undefined. The fashion industry ignores that 'oversized' only works if the proportions are intentional. It's not your body that's the problem; it's lazy pattern making. This mid-hip cut and high chimney collar instantly edit your silhouette, giving you structure where others just hang.

### Feature: The Pockets (Utility)
**Headline:** POCKETS THAT ACTUALLY WORK
**Body:** Women's clothing has normalized 'fake pockets' for so long that we’ve stopped expecting functionality. You find yourself clutching your phone and keys because your jacket is purely decorative. It’s a design failure that forces you to choose between clean lines and basic utility. Being unable to carry your essentials makes you look flustered, not effortless. These deep patch pockets are engineered to actually hold your phone without ruining the line, finally proving you don't have to sacrifice shape for function.
