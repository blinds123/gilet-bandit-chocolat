## Validation Checklist
- [ ] Did I use at least 3 distinct ENGAGE patterns? (Question, Contradiction, Stat, Story, etc.)
- [ ] Is the Founder Story a narrative, not a bio?
- [ ] Do the Secrets handle objections, not just list features?
- [ ] **Are Micro-Features using the Grabber/Paragraph structure?**
