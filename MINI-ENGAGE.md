# MINI-ENGAGE FORMULA (For Feature Cards)

## Purpose
For short-form copy (Feature Cards, Bullets), the full 6-step ENGAGE formula is too long. We distribute the load:
*   **Headline:** Handles the **E (Exploit)** or **G (Give Truth)**.
*   **Body:** Handles the **Pivot (Narrate/Attach)** and **Payoff (Guarantee)**.

## Structure
1.  **Headline:** [Exploit Disruption OR Controversial Truth]
2.  **Body Sentence 1:** [Pivot / Attach to Identity]
3.  **Body Sentence 2:** [Guarantee / Payoff]

## Examples (Approved)

### Example 1 (The Print)
*   **Headline (G - Truth):** THIS PRINT MAKES SILENCE LOUDER
*   **Body (Pivot):** When you wear 'safe' neutrals, you disappear into the background.
*   **Body (Payoff):** This bandana print forces them to look without you saying a word.

### Example 2 (The Texture)
*   **Headline (E - Exploit):** TEXTURE IS THE QUIET FLEX
*   **Body (Pivot):** Logos scream insecurity, but you've been trained to think 'wool' implies 'itchy torture'.
*   **Body (Payoff):** We hacked the fibers—10% Cashmere means you feel expensive, not scratchy.

### Example 3 (The Cut)
*   **Headline (E - Exploit):** YOU DON'T NEED BETTER CLOTHES, JUST BETTER PROPORTIONS
*   **Body (Pivot):** Standard cardigans hang like boxes and hide your waist.
*   **Body (Payoff):** This 'mid-hip' cut creates shape instantly, editing your look without a tailor.

### Example 4 (The Pockets)
*   **Headline (G - Truth):** POCKETS THAT ACTUALLY WORK
*   **Body (Pivot):** Fake pockets are a lie we stopped accepting.
*   **Body (Payoff):** These deep patch pockets hold your life while keeping your hands runway-ready.
